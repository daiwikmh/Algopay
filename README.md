## Features

### Gas Sponsorship
Every payment transaction is signed and fee-covered by the deployer account via a LogicSig gas pool. Users pay zero ALGO fees — the platform absorbs them.

### Merchant Registry
Merchants are registered on-chain by their `merchantRef`. When a payment settles, USDC is routed to the merchant's Algorand address via the Payment Processor contract.

### Agent-Based Spending Controls
Each API key has a gas pool. Within a pool you create agents — each agent has a daily USDC spending limit. Limits auto-reset every 24h. Agents can be suspended instantly.

### Payment Lifecycle
Every payment moves through: `pending → processing → settled` (or `failed`). Each state transition is recorded in a JSON timeline with timestamps and on-chain details.

### Webhook Delivery
Register HTTPS webhook endpoints for `payment_settled`, `payment_failed`, and `pool_low` events. Each delivery is logged with HTTP status, retries, and payload.

### Audit Log
Every key action (API key created, pool topped up, agent suspended, payment settled) is logged with user ID, IP, and request ID.

### Wallet Connect
Dashboard supports Pera and Defly wallets (Algorand testnet + mainnet). Connected address shows live ALGO and USDC balances.

```ts
import { Algopay } from 'algopay-stack'

const client = new Algopay({
  apiKey: 'ak_live_...',
  baseUrl: 'https://algopay-production-cc90.up.railway.app/api/v1',
  network: 'testnet',
})

// initiate and settle a payment
const payment = await client.payments.initiate({
  invoiceId: 'inv-001',
  agentId: '<agent-uuid>',
  poolId: '<pool-uuid>',
  merchantId: 'acme-001',
